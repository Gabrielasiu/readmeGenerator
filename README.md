# readmeGenerator

## Description

README Generator is an app created by and for students, coworkers and any 
user who may need to create a README.md file. 
Using nodejs I was able to create a README file that would be fill up automatically 
with the inputs from the user. I use one of my other projects README file as an example of 
what i want my generated README file to look like. 
I added a Title, Description, links, usage, credits and license, which i think are the most important things 
to add in a README file.  

For the creation of this website I use my recently learn knowledge in NODEjs and javascript logic.
